## Introduction

The Active Record design pattern is a software architecture pattern that is commonly used in object-oriented programming to interact with databases. It is a pattern for working with data in an object-oriented manner, where data is represented as objects and the database is used to persist these objects.

The main idea behind the Active Record pattern is that each object instance represents a database record and provides a high-level, object-oriented interface for accessing and manipulating the data stored in the database. This pattern combines the data access and data manipulation functionality into a single class, making it easy to work with the data in an intuitive and concise manner.

In the Active Record pattern, objects are responsible for both retrieving their own data from the database and updating their data back to the database. This is achieved by encapsulating the database access logic within the object's methods, eliminating the need for separate data access objects.

This pattern is particularly useful in web development, where it provides a simple way to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without having to write complex database access code. Additionally, the Active Record pattern can improve code readability and maintainability, as it allows you to work with data in an object-oriented manner, rather than having to manipulate data in a procedural style.
