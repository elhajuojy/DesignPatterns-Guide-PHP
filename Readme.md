# DESIGN PATTERNS

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

***
Design Patterns are categorized mainly into three categories: Creational Design Pattern, Structural Design Pattern, and Behavioral Design Pattern. These are differed from each other on the basis of their level of detail, complexity, and scale of applicability to the entire system being design.

***Creational Design Pattern***

As the name suggests, it provides the object or classes creation mechanism that enhance the flexibilities and reusability of the existing code. They reduce the dependency and controlling how the use interaction with our class so we wouldn't deal with the complex construction. Below are the various design pattern of creational design pattern.

***Structural Design Patterns***

Structural Design Patterns mainly responsible for assemble object and classes into a larger structure making sure that these structure should be flexible and efficient. They are very essential for enhancing readability and maintainability of the code. It also ensure that functionalities are properly separated, encapsulated. It reduces the minimal interface between interdependent things.

***Behavior Design Pattern***

Behavior Design Patterns are responsible for how one class communicates with others.

## Below is an image showing the relationship among the various design patterns as explained by the seminal design patterns work done by the gang of four.
